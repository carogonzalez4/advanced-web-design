    <h3>1. Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
    <p>
      I chose to analyse <i>Montford</i> because it was recognized as Site of the Day on Awwwards, which guarantees it as an outstanding project in terms of <strong>design, interactivity, and creative excellence. </strong> Moreover, the first impression is sophistication and modernity, it feels like a polished corporate site with immersive 3D touches that give it personality, well-suited for financial or investment sectors.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The website's content is carefully structured, it opens with a visually impactful homepage followed by sections explaining their services, value proposition, and institutional content. Likewise, it includes <strong>transitions</strong> between pages as you scroll, keeping the <strong>experience fluid and engaging</strong> to the user. Lastly the whole navigation throughout the web is concise prioritizing a systemized experience over a great quantity of sections.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Palette:</strong> The website uses a <strong>minimalist color palette</strong> that combines two main tones: a deep blue and a light neutral background. Nevertheless, as the user explores the different sections other colors appear that transport them to another atmosphere, without breaking its aesthetic. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/montford3?updatedAt=1760710798084" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <p>
      <strong>Typography:</strong> It presents itself as <strong>clean and professional,</strong> with clear hierarchy and high legibility. With that said, it uses uppercase for important parts and lowercase for more elongated information, catching the viewers attention without disrupting the web’s harmony. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/montford1?updatedAt=1760710491041" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <p>
      <strong>Branding:</strong> The distinctive logo and color scheme are
      consistently applied throughout, reinforcing brand identity.
     
    </p>

    <h3>4. Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
    <p>
      The site integrates various interactions like 3D transitions between pages as you scroll, and 3D graphics that move in some sections, immersing the user in an almost ethereal experience. Also, it includes subtle hover and scroll effects that balance dynamism without being distracting. To do so according to the technical notes on the Awwwards site, they used advanced 3D techniques or WebGL to renderize high performance graphics. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/montford4?updatedAt=1760710813099" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
  
    <h3>5. Usability & Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Clarity:</strong> The value proposition is clearly communicated from the start of the homepage, including <strong> visual calls to actions and relevant information.</strong> 
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/montford5?updatedAt=1760711169679" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <p>
      <strong>Accessibility:</strong> The use of 3D and heavy animations may create barriers for screen readers or low-end devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Loading:</strong> The weight of animations and 3D assets can slow performance on weaker connections.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The site presents advanced techniques (3D transitions, animations) which require careful optimization. This is possible due to its <strong>careful semantic HTML structure,</strong> which supports accessibility and visibility on search engines. According to its Awwwards profile, it scores well in Usability (7.4) and WPO (8.0); however, its accessibility could be interrupted on mobiles by heavy visual content.  
    </p>
    <h3>7. Excellence Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Creativity:</strong> The web stands out for bringing <strong>immersive 3D</strong> into a corporate environment in a balanced way, complementing information and graphics to maintain the user engaged. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content:</strong> It shows sober, client-focused content, without it being overestimulated. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UX:</strong> The site delivers a controlled, immersive browsing experience that it’s directed to a demanding audience that values innovation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Strenghts:</strong>  It presents a carefully designed aesthetic that includes an immersive experience with advanced technical implementation, which ultimately creates a <strong>strong brand character.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> It could cause potential performance issues on slower devices or networks; accessibility challenges in highly animated sections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Learnings:</strong> This site demonstrates how immersive technologies (3D, smooth transitions) can be integrated into serious corporate communication. Besides, it highlights the importance of balancing visual innovation with performance and accessibility to achieve true excellence.

    <h3>1. Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
    <p>
      I chose this page because it represents a creative portfolio from a digital agency that showcases their projects with a strong, bold visual tone. It's ideal for seeing how to communicate projects in an<strong>experiential, not just functional, way. </strong>
      Its first impression conveys the feeling of <strong>energy  boldness, and creativity.</strong> The repetition of words like <i>"Work-Work-Work..."</i> creates an effect of rhythm and intentional aggression that catches the user's attention. It's visually striking, almost performative, suggesting the agency is focusing on visual impact rather than restraint.
      
    </p>

    <h3>2. Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The website's content is carefully structured, it opens with a visually impactful homepage followed by sections explaining their services, value proposition, and institutional content. Likewise, it includes <strong>smooth transitions</strong> between pages as you scroll, keeping the browsing experience fluid and engaging to the user. Lastly the whole navigation throughout the web is concise prioritizing a systemized experience over a great quantity of sections.
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/Stiff1?updatedAt=1760713338530" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Palette:</strong>  It includes shades of black and light gray, with <strong>strong contrasts </strong> like yellow or red accents. Still it maintains tones of beige and white for the text to create balance.
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/stiff2?updatedAt=1760713464513" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <p>
      <strong>Typography:</strong>  The site presents a modern sans-serif typeface that has a strong presence using <strong>different weights to accent or stylize</strong> some parts. Besides, the use of typographic repetition mentioned before "Work Work Work" is used as a visual resource. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Branding:</strong> The aggressive and groundbreaking style is part of the identity: it's clear that they want their brand to be recognizable for its <strong>visual boldness.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
    <p>
      The site uses a <strong>mixed scroll system (vertical + horizontal)</strong> that creates a dynamic browsing rhythm and breaks the conventional flow, reinforcing its bold creative identity. Likewise,  content appears to "enter" or move as you scroll down. On the other hand, when you hover over project names (or active areas), there are <strong>hover animations/visual effects</strong> that highlight or change color, making sure the user interacts with the web. Finally, some elements like illustrations, like faces and the reach out button or even typography use animations like color and movement to draw attention. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/stiff3?updatedAt=1760713678273" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/stiff4?updatedAt=1760713762846" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <h3>5. Usability & Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Clarity:</strong> On one hand, the mixed vertical–horizontal scrolling creates visual impact,  however it may challenge usability for less experienced users or on mobile devices where horizontal gestures are less natural. On the other hand, the bold aesthetic may make initial interpretation difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Accessibility:</strong> For those using screen readers, contrast challenges in some overlays or animations may be challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Loading:</strong> Due to the many visual effects and graphical features, there is a risk of slow loading on weak connections.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The web uses modern techniques like <strong>CSS animations, javascript or even WebGL</strong> to achieve these bold and fun visual effects, which catches the users attention immediately. Likewise, the HTML semantics are respected and well organized, which would help its accessibility. However, when moving to a mobile performance the design isn’t well optimized and can confuse the user, showing a low professionality.  
    </p>
    <h3>7. Excellence Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Creativity:</strong> There’s a high level of creativity in the use of typographic repetition, bold visuals, and an attitude that conveys originality. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content:</strong> Not as dense with informational content but it has a more like visual content/project presence approach. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UX:</strong> This is a different UX, based on visual impact. For some users, it will work very well; for others, it may feel dense.
    </ul>
    <h3>8. Conclusion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Strenghts:</strong>  The website presents a visually striking, strong style, aesthetic coherence with the agency's identity, excellent for standing out. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> It can be overwhelming, as also there’s a <strong>risk of performance and accessibility issues.</strong> Moreover, the lack of visible explanatory content can make it difficult to understand the "what" of each project without research. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Learnings:</strong> Portrays a great way to show agency portfolios, it has a <strong>strong visual design</strong> that can draw attention, but it must be balanced with technical optimization and usability considerations to ensure it doesn't become repellent or inaccessible.

          <h3>1. Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
          <p>
            I chose Slosh Seltzer because it was awarded Site of the Day at Awwwards, indicating that it stands out in terms of design, interactivity, and creativity. Furthermore, it's a <strong>"maximalist design exploration"</strong> created by the <i>Buttermax agency</i> that showcases a bold visual proposal.
            The initial impression is one of immersion, energy, and surprise. From the first scroll, the interface "floods" visually, the can "rolls," and there are <strong>liquid animations and vibrant visual elements</strong> that convey a sense of freshness, fun, and controlled chaos.
          </p>
          <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/slosh1?updatedAt=1760714735257" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
          <h3>2. Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
          <p>
            The site is built more as a <strong>narrative experience</strong> than a traditional page with classic sections. Throughout the scroll, there are transitions that combine animations, fluid scrolling, and visual elements that change the layout. Moreover, <strong>textual information is minimal</strong> and is accompanied, or even dominated, by visual effects; it prioritizes showing rather than telling. It's not a site that follows a rigid of “Home, Services, About Us, Contact" architecture, but rather offers an immersive exploration experience.
          </p>
          <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/slosh3?updatedAt=1760714852292" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
          <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Palette:</strong>  The color palette uses <strong>saturated bright colors</strong> that create a vibrant and energetic atmosphere. Dominant use of a pastel pink magenta color as a distinctive chromatic element.
          </p>
          <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/slosh4?updatedAt=1760714972076" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
          <p>
            <strong>Typography:</strong> The web uses a large text, bold, modern typography. Likewise, the text appears to float, move, or animate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Branding:</strong>  Slosh's identity is projected as the <strong>"life of the party,"</strong> with visual references to bubbles, movement, liquidity, and a maximalist design. Also, the use of illustrations, pictorial effects, and decorative elements reinforce the brand's <strong>playful character.</strong>
          </p>
      
          <h3>4. Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the whole web there are multiple interactions that create a fun and attractive experience to the user. First, there’s a <strong>fluid cursor with a bubble effect,</strong> or in other words, a “fluid mouse interaction” effect that responds to mouse movement. Also, there are fluid transitions between sections, scrolling “fills” the screen generating waves or liquid scrolling visual effects with subtle animations or design elements. For instance, there’s a part where the user can choose the flavor of the drink by playing <strong>“virtual beerpong”,</strong> which complements the brand’s identity “life of the party” theme. In general, the site uses various 3D tools like WebGL or shaders to generate this visual distortions and mask effects. 
          </p>
          <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/slosh2?updatedAt=1760715190527" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
          <h3>5. Usability & Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Clarity:</strong> Visual storytelling allows for an <strong>emotional experience,</strong> but concrete information is somewhat overlooked. Users less accustomed to "experiential" experiences may feel lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accessibility:</strong> There are some risks regarding its animated content, as it may be difficult to access for screen readers or users with limited mobility. Besides, <strong>contrast and legibility</strong> in certain states may not be optimal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Loading:</strong> Due to the intensive use of visual effects and graphic resources, loading may be heavy on slow devices or connections.
          </p>
      
          <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
          <p>
            On the Awwwards page, performance appears as an evaluated point, although it is not perfect. Moreover, there are <strong>advanced technologies</strong> like mouse interactions, graphic effects, animations, that require rigorous technical optimization. Also, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/1l72h8i/has_anyone_cloned_sloshseltzercom_or_this_kind_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              technical communities
            </a> the site uses render buffers, custom shaders, and advanced 3D GLSL effects, which require GPU memory and can be penalized on mobile devices. Finally the semantics are just right to avoid compromising basic searching optimization; however, the technical focus is more on the visual experience.
          </p>
          <h3>7. Excellence Criteria</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Creativity:</strong> The website portrays a very high level of creativity, the project explores an unconventional maximalist aesthetic, with <strong>bold visual effects and an emotional concept.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content:</strong> Textual content is minimal but intended to support the visual experience. It's not a long-form informational site; it's a brand experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>UX:</strong> The experience is immersive and memorable, designed to excite rather than traditionally guide. It's high risk, but it has a powerful impact.
          </ul>
          <h3>8. Conclusion</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Strenghts:</strong> Visually stunning, immersive experiences, innovative effects, strong brand personality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Possible sacrifice of accessibility, <strong>loading time</strong> could increase on certain  devices; limited informative textual content, and reliance on effects to communicate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learnings:</strong> This site is an excellent reminder that visual innovation can elevate a brand, but it must be accompanied by technical optimization and careful experience so that it doesn't become a barrier. It also shows that a site can be more showoff than <i>informative,</i> depending on the brand's objective.

    <h3>1. Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
    <p>
      I chose Juice Agency because it's a renowned creative agency that combines branding, web design, and strategy. I consider it to be a good example of how an <strong>agency communicates its value,</strong> its portfolio, and its brand. Moreover, the initial impression is <strong>professional, commercial, and aspirational.</strong> Besides, the site conveys the idea that Juice not only makes beautiful sites, but also thinks strategically in a modern and high-end way.
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/juice5?updatedAt=1760716045782" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <h3>2. Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The homepage first showcases the <strong>value proposition: “Impactful digital experiences for ambitious brands.”</strong> Then they showcase a “Featured Work” with a gallery-like section of projects. Also, it has a clear “Capabilities” sections which offer services like branding, web & apps, marketing. They also display “Latest” (news/insights) to keep content fresh. On internal project pages  they combine project descriptions with results and images, <strong>complementing information with visual resources.</strong> In general, the whole architecture tends to prioritize work as the main element of credibility, without leaving aside its fun design. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/juice4?updatedAt=1760716149726" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <h3>3. Visual Design</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Palette:</strong> They use dark and neutral background colors, with <strong>accents to highlight elements</strong> such as buttons and project images.
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/juice6?updatedAt=1760716299358" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <p>
      <br>
      <strong>Typography:</strong> Modern, clear typography that conveys professionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Branding:</strong> Reinforces the identity of an agency specializing in design and technology, with a strong emphasis on <strong>"craft, design, and strategy" as values.</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
    <p>
      The website includes multiple interactions like <strong>hovering over projects in the gallery,</strong> which changes the appearance, highlighting or showing an overlay,  to indicate interactivity Also, there are <strong>transitions with smooth animations</strong> between pages when loading projects. Then, we can also see image loading effects, possibly lazy loading, with transition effects so they don't appear suddenly, creating visual harmony. Ultimately, elements like "See all work" or service buttons have microinteractions to <strong>reinforce their clickability.</strong>
    </p>
    <br>

    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/juice3?updatedAt=1760716610877" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <h3>5. Usability & Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Clarity:</strong> Navigation is straightforward, all the sections are clear from Work, Capabilities, Latest, Contact to the About, so the user knows where to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Accessibility:</strong> There should be a <strong>revision of text contrasts</strong> on dark backgrounds for an easy reading.
    </p>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/trtlpmdnft/Sow/juice2?updatedAt=1760716898049" alt="ejemplo" class="img-uniform">
    <p>
      <br>
      <strong>Loading:</strong> With many project images and possible animations, it's important that the images are optimized and lazy-loaded in a correct way. 
    </p>

    <h3>6. Technical Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The HTML semantics appear to be respected, with services sections, projects, descriptive text, ensuring its <strong>easy accessibility.</strong> However, because of the overload of images and in general a visually intensive portfolio, there could be technical challenges for the Core Web Visuals. Also, the <strong>responsiveness has to be revised</strong> so the the text is not overlapped by images or other elements any time.
