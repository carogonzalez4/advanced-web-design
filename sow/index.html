    <h3>Selection & Initial Impression</h3>
    <p>
      I chose to analyse Montfort because it was recognized as Site of the Day on Awwwards, which guarantees it as an outstanding project in terms of design, interactivity, and creative excellence. Moreover, the first impression is sophistication and modernity, it feels like a polished corporate site with immersive 3D touches that give it personality, well-suited for financial or investment sectors.
    </p>

    <h3>Structure & Information Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The website's content is carefully structured, it opens with a visually impactful homepage followed by sections explaining their services, value proposition, and institutional content. Likewise, it includes smooth transitions bewtween pages as you scroll, keeping the browsing experience fluid and engaging. Lastly the whole navigation trhoughout the web is concise; the site prioritizes a curated experience over a great quantity of sections.
    </p>

    <h3>Visual Design</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Palette:</strong> The use of two main colors, a deep blue and a neutral background create a professional and trustworthy atmosphere while keeping a minamalist style. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Typography:</strong> Modern sans-serif fonts with varying weights
      create clear content separation. Headings are bold and impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Branding:</strong> The distinctive logo and color scheme are
      consistently applied throughout, reinforcing brand identity.
    </p>

    <h3>Interaction & Microinteractions</h3>
    <p>
      The site features smooth hover effects on project cards, revealing
      additional information on interaction. Scroll-triggered animations add
      dynamism without overwhelming the user. Filter and sorting options provide
      excellent control over content discovery.
    </p>

    <h3>Usability & Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Clarity:</strong> Information is well-organized with clear
      calls-to-action. Project details are easy to access.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Accessibility:</strong> While visually impressive, some contrast
      ratios could be improved for better readability. Keyboard navigation is
      generally well-implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Loading:</strong> Initial load is reasonably fast, though heavy
      use of images requires optimization.
    </p>

    <h3>Technical Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The site demonstrates solid technical implementation with lazy loading for
      images and efficient resource management. However, the abundance of visual
      content can impact Core Web Vitals, particularly on slower connections.
      The semantic HTML structure supports SEO and accessibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Excellence Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Creativity:</strong> The design successfully balances creativity
        with functionality, serving as both a showcase and a functional
        directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content:</strong> Rich, curated content with detailed project
        descriptions and credits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UX:</strong> User experience is generally excellent, with
        intuitive navigation and discovery features.
      </li>
    </ul>
